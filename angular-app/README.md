# Angular App (minimal scaffold)

This folder contains a minimal Angular project scaffold pinned to latest stable Angular as of when this scaffold was created.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

1. From project root run:

```powershell
cd d:\\SELF\\angular-app
npm install
npx ng serve --open
```

Notes:
- This scaffold pins Angular packages to the latest stable versions available at creation time (Angular 20.x). If you want to change versions, edit `package.json`.
- If you prefer to use the global `ng` CLI: `npm i -g @angular/cli` then `ng serve`.

Files created: basic `angular.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/` with `main.ts`, `polyfills.ts`, and a simple `AppComponent`.
